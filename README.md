pipeworld-android
============

This is the android port of the pipeworld game made by ragingRobot https://github.com/ragingRobot/Pipes
It's nothing fancy, just a webview that loads the locally stored html files of the original game. 
I just wanted to make it instantly playable without Internet (the app doesn't require any permissions) and with 
a quick access icon for my smartphone.

Feel free to contribute with pull requests to the original project by Gabriele or to this one if you have any android 
specific improvements in mind.
